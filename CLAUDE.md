## Response Format

All tools return formatted text with:

- ‚úÖ Success indicator

- üìñ Calendar section headers
- ‚ùå Error indicators when applicable
- Liturgical grade (Weekday, Memorial, Feast, Solemnity, etc.)
- Liturgical colors (green, red, white, purple, rose)
- Event names localized to requested locale

## Understanding Liturgical Data

### Liturgical Grades

Events are ranked by importance:

- **Weekday** (0): Regular weekdays
- **Commemoration** (1): Minor commemorations
- **Optional Memorial** (2): Optional celebrations
- **Memorial** (3): Obligatory memorials
- **Feast** (4): Feast days
- **Feast of the Lord** (5): Important feast days of Jesus
- **Solemnity** (6): Highest-ranking celebrations
- **Higher Solemnity** (7): Takes precedence over regular solemnities

### Liturgical Colors

- **White**: Christmas, Easter, celebrations of the Lord, Mary, angels, and non-martyred saints
- **Red**: Palm Sunday, Good Friday, Pentecost, celebrations of martyrs
- **Green**: Ordinary Time
- **Purple/Violet**: Advent and Lent
- **Rose**: Third Sunday of Advent (Gaudete Sunday) and Fourth Sunday of Lent (Laetare Sunday)

### Calendar Types

#### General Roman Calendar

The universal calendar for the entire Roman Catholic Church.

#### National Calendars

Include celebrations specific to a nation (patron saints, national holy days).

#### Diocesan Calendars

Include celebrations specific to a diocese (local patron saints, dedications of local churches).

## Best Practices

1. **Start with list_available_calendars** to see what's available before querying specific calendars
1. **Use appropriate locales** for the user's language preference
1. **Default to current year** when year is not specified
1. **Handle errors gracefully** - invalid nation/diocese codes will return helpful error messages
1. **Consider date ranges** - the API supports years 1970-9999
1. **Use General Calendar** for universal celebrations, national/diocesan for local variations

## Common Use Cases

### Planning Liturgical Celebrations

"What major solemnities are coming up in the next 3 months?"

### Educational Purposes

"Explain the liturgical season of Lent and its major celebrations"

### Parish Planning

"Show me the diocesan calendar for Boston for the entire year 2025"

### Cross-Cultural Understanding

"Compare the Italian and American liturgical calendars - what's different?"

## Limitations

- API is in development mode (dev endpoint)
- Some dioceses may not be available in all years
- Responses are truncated at 50 events for readability (full data still retrieved)
- Historical accuracy only from 1970 forward

## Error Handling

The server provides clear error messages:

- API connectivity issues
- Missing required parameters

Always check error messages for guidance on correct usage.

## Technical Notes

- No authentication required
- Public API with no rate limiting specified
- Timeout set to 30 seconds for requests
- All responses in JSON format from API
- Formatted for readability by the MCP server
